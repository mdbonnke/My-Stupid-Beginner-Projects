# My-Stupid-Beginner-Projects
I have started my journey in web development with HTML, CSS, and JS. I'll keep my journey, mistakes, triumphs, and everything in between for posterity and memory. If you notice something that I have done please let me know. The challenge of being self-taught is you don't know what you don't know. Thanks for being here.
